function PowerSpectrum( hax, rawData, Fs )
%POWERSPECTRUM Plots power vs frequency for raw signal data
%   Obtain the periodogram using fft. The signal is real-valued and has
%       even length. Because the signal is real-valued, you only need power
%       estimates for the positive or negative frequencies. In order to
%       conserve the total power, multiply all frequencies that occur in
%       both sets -- the positive and negative frequencies -- by a factor
%       of 2. Zero frequency (DC) and the Nyquist frequency do not occur
%       twice. Plot the result.
